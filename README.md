# WHAT IS WING CHUN, AND WHY I CHOSE IT FOR MY "TAKE" ON ELIZA (see more about Eliza in the STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS section below)

If you've ever seen Ip Man, (or most Kung Fu movies) you'll often see the hero or heroine training with a Wing Chun dummy... the wooden pole with a few "arms" sticking out.  It is immovable, forcing the practioner to adapt to it; similar to how a coder must adapt to the interpreter or compiler they're dealing with.  

At face value, the Eliza chatbot seems to use "verbal judo" rephrasing one's statement into a question.  But, one might also view the Eliza chatbot in the same light as a Wing Chun dummy -- that its position is fixed, and although it prompts the user with a variety of responses,

### What I did NOT create?

  * "Wing Chun" is an implementation of the Eliza Bot built on top of Keith Weaver's implementation which can be viewed here: http://keithweaver.github.io/eliza/

  * Special THANKS to this code pen for the neon glow: https://codepen.io/FelixRilling/pen/qzfoc which I modified to apply to box shadows

### What I DID create?

  * custom responses that go beyond "rubber ducking"  
	* While working on coding challenges upon graduation Flatiron Software Engineering School, I often attempt to find a "better" way to solve a problem than how I do the first time around, always with a goal of finding what is not only essential but what generalizes.  I have blogged about many of my experiences and approaches here, constantly refactoring for self improvement: https://comedytragedyepic.com/learning-advice/  
	* Perhaps the two approaches most relevant to what I'm attempting here, with "Wing Chun", can be read in my blog post: A Recursive Approach to Problem Solving: https://comedytragedyepic.com/a-recursive-approach-to-problem-solving/ and a note card that I keep beside my computer desk.  The note card is a list of 12 verbs
