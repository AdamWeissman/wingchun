# WHAT IS WING CHUN, AND WHY I CHOSE IT FOR MY "TAKE" ON ELIZA (see more about Eliza in the STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS section below)

If you've ever seen Ip Man, (or most Kung Fu movies) you'll often see the hero or heroine training with a Wing Chun dummy... the wooden pole with a few "arms" sticking out.  It is immovable, forcing the practioner to adapt to it; similar to how a coder must adapt to the interpreter or compiler they're dealing with... or whatever constraints they are working around, whether constraits imposed from outside (by technology, a client, or otherwise), or constraints from within: what one is capable of.

At face value, the Eliza chatbot might be reduced to "verbal judo" as it rephrases one's statement into a question.  But, one might also view the Eliza chatbot in the same light as a Wing Chun dummy -- as a fixed object which one must conform/adhere to in order to attain some victory.  By analogy, this quote by Bruce Lee gives some idea of how you might approach practice against something like a Wing Chun dummy:

> "Empty your mind; be formless, shapeless â€“ like water. Now you put 
> water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it 
> becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now > water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."

In other words, as one who codes, and in my current position as a Teaching Coach (as of January 2nd, 2021), I find that one of the most harmful mindsets for the novice coder (and even the adept) is the idea that something we did "should work" ... 

However, embracing the idea, that if something does not work, then it also SHOULD NOT, has been a game changer for me.  With this "Wing Chun" implementation/spin on the Eliza bot, my hope is for coders to go beyond "rubber ducking" and approach code in such a way that it could be considered an extension of one's approach to problem solving in life.

There is too much to cover here in terms of philosophy, though I can often be found on LinkedIn to chat: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adweissman/

In the spirit of the "fixed arms" on a Wing Chun dummy, I keep a notecard beside my computer monitor that I have found helpful when tackling coding challenges.  On that note card I have the following words, words that serve as reminders to the most basic constraints of what one can do with code:

1) Compare
2) Combine
3) Call
4) Assign
5) Track
6) Sample
7) Swap
8) Sort
9) Replace
10) Return
11) Create
12) Iterate

Lastly, I've attempted to spin Eliza into something that more closely resembles the Socratic Method, especially in the context of The Five Whys, or as adapted by Eliyahu Goldratt with his Theory of Constraints.

# STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS - THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE LARGELY UN-ORIGINAL

### What I did NOT create?

  * "Wing Chun" is an implementation of the Eliza Bot built on top of Keith Weaver's implementation which can be viewed here: http://keithweaver.github.io/eliza/  
  * To see the original repo and see all original documentation, please visit https://github.com/keithweaver/eliza

  * My images are from the NOUN PROJECT, see the individual PNGs in the asset folder attribution.  
  * Special THANKS to this code pen for the neon glow: https://codepen.io/FelixRilling/pen/qzfoc which I modified to apply to box shadows  
	* Also am in awe of the creators of this https://www.vantajs.com/  

### What I DID create?

  * custom responses that go beyond "rubber ducking"
	* While working on coding challenges upon graduation Flatiron Software Engineering School, I often attempt to find a "better" way to solve a problem than how I do the first time around, always with a goal of finding what is not only essential but what generalizes.  I have blogged about many of my experiences and approaches here, constantly refactoring for self improvement: https://comedytragedyepic.com/learning-advice/  
	* Perhaps the two approaches most relevant to what I'm attempting here, with "Wing Chun", can be read in my blog post: A Recursive Approach to Problem Solving: https://comedytragedyepic.com/a-recursive-approach-to-problem-solving/ and the note card that I keep beside my computer desk which is covered in the intro section.
