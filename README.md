# WHAT IS WING CHUN, AND WHY I CHOSE IT FOR MY "TAKE" ON ELIZA (see more about Eliza in the STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS section below)

If you've ever seen Ip Man, (or most Kung Fu movies) you'll often see the hero or heroine training with a Wing Chun dummy; the wooden pole with a few "arms" sticking out.  It is immovable, forcing the practioner to adapt to it; similar to how a coder must adapt to the interpreter or compiler they're dealing with or whatever constraints they must navigate.  Whether constraits imposed from outside (by technology, a client, or otherwise), or constraints from within: what one is capable of.

In the context of martial arts, the Eliza chatbot might be viewed as a form of "verbal judo" as it frequently rephrases one's statements into a question.  Bridging the concept of the Eliza Chatbot and what I'm attempting with my "Wing Chun" version is __a chatbot that will help coders more quickly recognize the constraints of a problem.__ 

As a teaching coach, and forever student, I've found that one of the biggest obstacles to achieving anything is getting stuck in a fixed mindset, getting lost in the details of the wrong problem.  To that end I find the following quote by Bruce Lee aspirational:

> "Empty your mind; be formless, shapeless â€“ like water. Now you put 
> water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it 
> becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now 
> water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."

In other words, my ultimate goal for this chatbot is to serve as a "pattern interrupt" that will help the user stay "fluid".  To do that, the "arms" of my Wing Chun Dummy represent that most common constraints I've found helpful when tackling coding challenges; what follows is a list of words that I have on a notecard beside my computer monitor; they serve as fundamental building blocks of most any coding challenge, and reflecting on where one might come in handy or not, often serves as a creative spring board that allows me to "be like water" when facing a coding challenge.  The "arms" of my Wing Chun dummy are:

1) Compare
2) Combine
3) Call
4) Assign
5) Track
6) Sample
7) Swap
8) Sort
9) Replace
10) Return
11) Create
12) Iterate

# STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS - THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT ARE LARGELY UN-ORIGINAL

### What I did NOT create?

  * "Wing Chun" is an implementation of the Eliza Bot built on top of Keith Weaver's implementation which can be viewed here: http://keithweaver.github.io/eliza/  
  * To see the original repo and see all original documentation, please visit https://github.com/keithweaver/eliza  
  * To learn more about ELIZA, please visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA  
  * My images are from the NOUN PROJECT, see the individual PNGs in the asset folder attribution.  
  * Special THANKS to this code pen for the neon glow: https://codepen.io/FelixRilling/pen/qzfoc which I modified to apply to box shadows  
	* Also am in awe of the creators of this https://www.vantajs.com/  

### What I DID create?

  * custom responses that go beyond "rubber ducking"
	* While working on coding challenges upon graduation Flatiron Software Engineering School, I often attempt to find a "better" way to solve a problem than how I do the first time around, always with a goal of finding what is not only essential but what generalizes.  I have blogged about many of my experiences and approaches here, constantly refactoring for self improvement: https://comedytragedyepic.com/learning-advice/  
	* Perhaps the two approaches most relevant to what I'm attempting here, with "Wing Chun", can be read in my blog post: A Recursive Approach to Problem Solving: https://comedytragedyepic.com/a-recursive-approach-to-problem-solving/ and the note card that I keep beside my computer desk which is covered in the intro section.

## WHY ALL THE STYLING?

I've found that a pleasant aesthetic experience causes us to be more reflective and a little more thoughtful, which is the goal of my Eliza remix.
