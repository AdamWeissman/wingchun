# WHAT IS WING CHUN, AND WHY I CHOSE IT FOR MY "TAKE" ON ELIZA

If you've ever seen Ip Man, (or most Kung Fu movies) you'll see the hero or heroine training with a Wing Chun dummy... that wooden pole that mimics an adversary.  

Like Eliza (the chatbot that in one regard uses "verbal judo" to rephrase one's statement into a question (to help the questioner gain perspective and insight), the Wing Chun dummy also reminds me of a sharpening stone on which one sharpens a blade (or in this case, one's skills).
